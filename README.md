Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### Interface

To change a city, you need to click the 'Citites' button or the geotag in top-left corner. Then you have to type the city you want (there is autocomplete) and tap on the wanted city. If you won't tap on the suggested cities, nothing will happen.

### Start City

The start city is New York, all info is from there.

### Timer

Always show you your current time + GMT. Maybe I'll fix it later.

### Slider 

Slider on the right shows you approximate weather for 5 next days. You can control the chosen day with arrows or swipe them.

### Activities 

Now it's just static pictures.

### 24-hour forecast

Couldn't find it in suggested API, so left a funny picture. For the same reason UV Index replaced with Air Pollution Index.

### Adaptive Design

I'm a newbie in adaptability, so it can be not so good as you wait. Originally made for 24'' 1080p monitor and shrinked down to 720p, but still...

### Favourite citites

Will be added later.
